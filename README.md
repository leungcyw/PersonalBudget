# Personal Budgeting Tool

My personal budgeting tool to keep track of my finances, taking advantage of Google Sheets and Google Forms for an elegant user interface.
Data is inputted through Google Form, and output is rendered in Google Sheets. 
The *Code.gs* file is the only necessary program, and consists of Google Apps Script code used in Google Sheets.
Through these functions, the spreadsheet can create visualizable data without any manual interactions with spreadsheet cells. 

## Set Up Instructions
### 1. Create Google Form ###
This set of instructions assume that you have a Google account with access to Google Drive. From the Google Drive page, create a new Google Form through `New -> More -> Google Forms`. The Google Form will have three questions.  
Set the first question to be the `Category`. 

### 2. Connect to Google Sheets ###


### 3. Add the Script to Google Sheets ###
