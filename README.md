# My Personal Budgeting Tool

My personal budgeting tool to keep track of my finances, using Google Sheets and Google Forms. Data is inputted through the Google Form, which renders
outputs to the Google Sheets sheet. The *Code.gs* file consists of Google Apps Script code used in the Google Sheet, so that the Google Sheet can create
visualizable data without interactions to any of the sheets cells.
